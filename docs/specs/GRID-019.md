### GRID-019: Open Source License Selection and Implementation

**GitHub Issue**: #50 (public tracking)
**Spec Purpose**: Evaluate and select an open source license, add LICENSE and notices, and update repository metadata to reflect the chosen license.
**Status**: üìã Research
**Priority**: Medium
**Created**: 2025-08-30

## Technical Overview
This spec defines how GridPulse will adopt an open source license. It evaluates candidate licenses, documents decision criteria, and outlines the implementation steps to add a LICENSE file, update repository metadata, and communicate the choice. The selection should align with project goals: open collaboration, community contributions, compatibility with common JS/TS ecosystems, and clarity on permissions, conditions, and patent grants.

## Implementation Requirements
- [ ] Select an OSI-approved license based on criteria below
- [ ] Add root-level `LICENSE` file with the exact approved text
- [ ] Update `package.json` `license` field to SPDX identifier
- [ ] Update `README.md` with license badge/section and link to `LICENSE`
- [ ] Add copyright notice and year in `LICENSE` name section
- [ ] Add `NOTICE` file if required by selected license (e.g., Apache-2.0)
- [ ] Create `docs/legal/` with brief rationale and obligations summary
- [ ] Add PR/issue templates guidance to reference license obligations if needed
- [ ] Verify third-party dependencies‚Äô license compatibility
- [ ] Confirm CI and distribution artifacts include license where appropriate

## Decision Criteria
- Permissiveness vs. copyleft strength (contribution and adoption goals)
- Patent grant scope and termination conditions
- Notice and attribution requirements for redistributions
- Compatibility with npm ecosystem and common contributors‚Äô preferences
- Corporate/commercial adoption friendliness
- Enforceability clarity and OSI approval
- Simplicity of compliance for contributors and users

## Candidates Considered
Note: Final choice should incorporate the owner‚Äôs ‚Äúopen source license options‚Äù document referenced outside this repo. Pending that input, the likely short list is:
- MIT: Simple, permissive; no explicit patent grant
- Apache-2.0: Permissive with explicit patent license and NOTICE requirements
- GPL-3.0-only/-or-later: Strong copyleft; impacts downstream proprietary use
- LGPL-3.0: Weak copyleft for libraries; less friction than GPL
- MPL-2.0: File-level copyleft; good balance for some ecosystems

Recommendation if no additional constraints from the owner document: Apache-2.0 (permits wide adoption, includes patent grant, has clear NOTICE obligations). MIT remains acceptable if minimal obligations are preferred and patent risks are deemed low.

## Implementation Details
- LICENSE: Use exact upstream text from OSI; do not modify wording
- package.json: `"license": "Apache-2.0"` (or selected SPDX)
- README: Add ‚ÄúLicense‚Äù section: short description + link to LICENSE + badge
- NOTICE (if applicable): List project copyright and any required attributions
- Source headers: Optional; only if policy requires. Prefer repo-level LICENSE/NOTICE
- Docs: Add `docs/legal/license-rationale.md` with: chosen license, alternatives considered, obligations summary, and FAQs

## Dependencies & Integration
- Documentation workflow (docs/): ensure references and badges are consistent
- CI/release: verify packaged artifacts include LICENSE (and NOTICE if required)
- GitHub settings: add repository license via UI when convenient (optional)

## Research Notes
- MIT and Apache-2.0 are the most common for TypeScript OSS; Apache‚Äôs patent grant is often preferred for org adoption
- Copyleft options (GPL/MPL/LGPL) may deter some adopters but can be appropriate if ensuring open derivatives is a goal
- Some ecosystems (e.g., clients embedding code) prefer permissive licensing to reduce obligations

## Testing Strategy
- Validate `npm pack` includes `LICENSE` (and `NOTICE` if applicable)
- Confirm `package.json` license passes `npm`/GitHub detection
- Verify README links and badges render correctly
- Manual compliance review against OSI text and project files

## Licensing Strategy (Owner Input)

# Licensing Strategy for [Project Name]

This document records the research, options considered, and final decisions regarding licensing for the project‚Äôs different types of artifacts (software code, documentation, and data). It also includes all relevant snippets, templates, and recommended usage for citation and attribution.

## 1. Options Considered

### 1.1 Software Code
- **MIT License**: Very permissive, requires attribution, no copyleft.  
- **BSD 3-Clause License**: Permissive, attribution required, non-endorsement clause, no copyleft. No NOTICE mechanism.  
- **Apache License 2.0**: Permissive, attribution required, includes explicit patent grant, and importantly allows a **NOTICE file** for persistent attribution/citation requests.  

**Key Concern**: Desire for a way to request citations and acknowledgments beyond the standard legal attribution.

**Decision**: Use **Apache License 2.0** for code.  
**Rationale**: Apache 2.0 provides all the benefits of a permissive license plus the NOTICE mechanism, which we can use to request citations in software and publications.

---

### 1.2 Documentation
- **BSD / Apache**: Possible, but these are not recommended for non-code creative works.  
- **Creative Commons (CC-BY 4.0)**: Explicitly designed for creative works (docs, text, media). Permissive and attribution required. No copyleft unless using CC-BY-SA.  

**Decision**: Use **CC-BY 4.0** for documentation.  
**Rationale**: Best practice for non-code creative works; ensures attribution is carried forward in academic and derivative uses.

---

### 1.3 Datasets
- **BSD / Apache**: Not a good fit for datasets.  
- **CC-BY 4.0**: Explicitly allows free reuse and requires attribution; commonly used in research datasets.  

**Decision**: Use **CC-BY 4.0** for datasets.  
**Rationale**: Widely accepted in open data, requires attribution in both research and commercial reuse.

---

### 1.4 Overall Licensing Model
- **Code** ‚Üí Apache 2.0  
- **Documentation** ‚Üí CC-BY 4.0  
- **Datasets** ‚Üí CC-BY 4.0  
- **NOTICE file** ‚Üí Provides attribution + standard citation format for all artifact types.

**Rationale for Overall Decision**:  
This combination balances maximum openness (permissive code license) with enforceable attribution (CC-BY for docs/data and Apache NOTICE for code). It keeps the project fully open-source, ensures compatibility with other OSS projects, and supports citation in academic and professional use.
