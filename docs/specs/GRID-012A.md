# GRID-012A: CDKTF Infrastructure as Code Implementation

**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2025-08-28  
**Updated**: 2025-08-29  

**Parent**: [GRID-012](./GRID-012.md) - TimescaleDB Schema Implementation  
**GitHub Issue**: [#26](https://github.com/awynne/grid/issues/26)

## Overview

Replaced non-idempotent bash scripts with declarative, type-safe Infrastructure as Code using CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) with TypeScript, enabling idempotent environment lifecycle management for Railway deployments. Added a Docker-first CI workflow that publishes images to GHCR and triggers automated redeploys on Railway.

## Problem Statement

Current infrastructure management suffers from:
- **Non-idempotent scripts** requiring manual cleanup
- **Generic Terraform** without React Router 7-specific patterns
- **No programmatic destroy/recreate** workflows
- **Manual Railway service management** prone to human error
- **Inconsistent deployment artifacts** leading to "works on my machine" issues
- **Long deployment times** due to Railway build process on every deploy

## Scope

### In Scope
- CDKTF project setup with Railway provider integration
- TypeScript-based environment stack definitions
- Idempotent environment lifecycle management (create/destroy/recreate)
- React Router 7-aware service configurations
- **Docker-first deployment architecture** with container registry integration
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** optimized for Railway deployment
- Automated environment variable and secrets management
- Complete replacement of bash scripts with declarative workflows
- **Docker and Git deployment method** support with automatic selection

### Out of Scope  
- Python data service implementation (GRID-013 dependency)
- Advanced Railway features (volumes, custom domains)
- Multi-region deployments
- CI/CD pipeline integration (future enhancement)

## Technical Architecture

### CDKTF Implementation Strategy

**Technology Stack:**
- **CDK for Terraform (CDKTF)** - HashiCorp official project
- **Railway Provider** - `terraform-community-providers/railway` (community-maintained, production-ready)
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe infrastructure definitions
- **Railway GraphQL API** - Underlying platform integration

**Key Benefits:**
- **Declarative** - Define desired state, CDKTF manages convergence
- **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times, only applies changes
- **Type-safe** - Compile-time validation of infrastructure configurations
- **React Router 7 native** - TypeScript aligns with frontend development
- **Docker-first** - Container deployment for consistency and speed

### Docker-First Decision Analysis

**Research Findings:**
- **Time Investment**: Docker implementation now (4 hours) vs. later migration (6+ hours)
- **Deployment Speed**: Docker deployment (30 seconds) vs. Git build (5+ minutes)
- **Consistency**: Same container image across test/staging/production environments
- **Rollback Speed**: Instant version pinning vs. Git commit reverting

**Implementation Rationale:**
1. **Easier Now**: No existing production deployment to migrate from
2. **Better Repeatability**: Immutable container images eliminate deployment variations
3. **Reliability**: Pre-tested container images reduce deployment failure risk
4. **Future-Proof**: Container-first approach scales better for multiple services

```

## Implementation Details

### Environment Stack Architecture

```typescript
interface GridPulseEnvironmentConfig {
  projectId: string;
  environmentName: string;
  railwayToken: string;
  postgresPassword: string;
  sessionSecret: string;
  eiaApiKey?: string;
}

class GridPulseEnvironment extends Construct {
  public readonly environment: Environment;
  public readonly webService: Service;
  public readonly postgresService: Service; 
  public readonly redisService: Service;
  public dataService?: Service; // Future: GRID-013
}
```

### React Router 7 Service Configuration

```typescript
// Web service configuration prefers Docker image if provided; otherwise Git build
this.webService = new Service(this, "web", config.dockerImage
  ? {
      name: "web",
      projectId: config.projectId,
      sourceImage: config.dockerImage,
      sourceImageRegistryUsername: config.dockerUsername,
      sourceImageRegistryPassword: config.dockerPassword,
    }
  : {
      name: "web",
      projectId: config.projectId,
    }
);

// Web environment variables (PORT, SESSION_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, etc.)
const webVariables = [
  { name: "NODE_ENV", value: "production" },
  { name: "PORT", value: "3000" },
  { name: "SESSION_SECRET", value: config.sessionSecret },
  // Database and Redis connections configured automatically
];
```

### Database Service (TimescaleDB)

```typescript
// PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension
this.postgresService = new Service(this, "postgres", {
  name: `postgres-${config.environmentName}`,
  projectId: config.projectId,
  sourceImage: "timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15",
});

// Database configuration
new Variable(this, "postgres_db", {
  environmentId: this.environment.id,
  serviceId: this.postgresService.id,
  name: "POSTGRES_DB",
  value: "railway",
});
```

## Management Workflows

### Environment Lifecycle Commands

```bash
# Idempotent environment recreation
./scripts/manage-environments.sh recreate test

# Incremental deployments  
./scripts/manage-environments.sh deploy test

# Infrastructure planning
./scripts/manage-environments.sh plan test

# Status monitoring
./scripts/manage-environments.sh status test
```

### Setup Process

```bash
# One-time setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# Regular deployment workflow
./scripts/manage-environments.sh plan test
./scripts/manage-environments.sh deploy test
```

## CI/CD Outcome

- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml` builds and pushes GHCR images on `main`.
- Railway redeploy is triggered automatically after image push:
  - CLI-based via `RAILWAY_TOKEN` (default/fallback)
  - API-based via GraphQL when `RAILWAY_TOKEN`, `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, and `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` are provided
- CDKTF infra updates are gated behind `DEPLOY_WITH_CDKTF` to avoid creating existing environments; image deployment is decoupled.

### Post-Deployment Database Migrations (Pending Implementation)

**Requirement**: Automatic database schema updates must execute after successful Railway deployment to ensure production database stays synchronized with application code.

**Integration Point**: Add migration trigger step in `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml` after Railway redeploy completion (line 95-104).

**Implementation Approach**:
- Execute `scripts/setup-database.sh` remotely on Railway service after successful deployment
- Use Railway CLI or API to run migration commands in production environment  
- Implement proper error handling - deployment should fail if migrations fail
- Add migration status verification to ensure schema changes applied correctly

**Error Handling Requirements**:
- Migration failures must cause CI pipeline to fail and notify developers
- Include migration logs in CI output for debugging
- Implement rollback strategy for failed schema changes
- Verify database connectivity before attempting migrations

**Dependencies**: Requires Railway service to be successfully deployed and responding to health checks before migration execution.

## Notes

This implementation provides **true Infrastructure as Code** for Railway deployments:

âœ… **Declarative** - Define desired state, not imperative steps  
âœ… **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times without side effects  
âœ… **Type-safe** - Catch configuration errors at compile time  
âœ… **Version controlled** - Infrastructure changes tracked in git  
âœ… **React Router 7 native** - TypeScript development workflow alignment  

The CDKTF approach eliminates all manual cleanup requirements and provides a foundation for scaling infrastructure management as GridPulse grows from MVP to production scale.

**Key Innovation**: Using TypeScript for infrastructure matches the React Router 7 frontend development workflow, reducing context switching and leveraging existing team TypeScript expertise for infrastructure management.
