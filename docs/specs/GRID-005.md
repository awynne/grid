# GRID-005: Documentation Terminology Standardization

**GitHub Issue**: #8 (public tracking)
**Spec Purpose**: Technical specification for standardizing ambiguous terminology across documentation
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Priority**: Medium
**Created**: 2025-08-21

## Technical Overview
Standardize inconsistent and ambiguous terminology throughout the project documentation to eliminate confusion between different concepts. The primary issue was the ambiguous use of "task" which sometimes referred to GRID-XXX specification files and sometimes to general work items, creating confusion in workflow discussions.

## Implementation Requirements
- [x] Replace "task" → "spec" when referring to GRID-XXX.md files in docs/specs/
- [x] Replace "GitHub issue" → "issue" for consistency and brevity
- [x] Update "Related Tasks" → "Related Specs" in all GRID-XXX.md files
- [x] Update "Task Status" → "Spec Status" throughout documentation
- [x] Update cross-references and navigation links
- [x] Preserve meaning while improving clarity
- [x] Maintain functional cross-references after changes
- [x] Validate all links work correctly

## Research Notes
- **Terminology Analysis**: Found 94+ instances of "task" used ambiguously across documentation
- **Impact Assessment**: 13 files required updates to maintain consistency
- **Cross-Reference Mapping**: All internal links preserved during terminology updates
- **Context Preservation**: Maintained exact meaning while improving clarity

## Implementation Details
### Files Modified (13 total):
1. **docs/process.md** - Core workflow documentation (35+ changes)
2. **docs/coding.md** - Development standards (8+ changes)  
3. **docs/specs/status.md** - Status overview page
4. **docs/specs/GRID-001.md through GRID-004.md** - Individual specifications
5. **docs/README.md** - Navigation and overview
6. **docs/activity/daily.md & weekly.md** - Activity logs
7. **docs/documentation.md** - Meta-documentation
8. **docs/prd.md** - Product requirements

### Terminology Standardization Rules:
- **"spec"** = technical specifications in docs/specs/GRID-XXX.md files
- **"issue"** = GitHub issues for public tracking  
- **"work item"** = general development work (when neither "spec" nor "issue" applies)

### Cross-Reference Updates:
- Updated all navigation links to use consistent terminology
- Preserved all functional links during terminology changes
- Maintained backward compatibility in workflow processes

## Dependencies & Integration
- Technical dependencies: None
- Cross-cutting concerns: All documentation files affected
- Breaking changes: None - only terminology clarity improvements
- Integration notes: Changes maintain existing workflow while improving clarity

## Testing Strategy
- Manual validation: All cross-references tested for functionality
- Link checking: Verified all internal links work correctly
- Terminology audit: Confirmed consistent usage across all files
- Workflow verification: Ensured process documentation remains accurate

## Definition of Done
- [x] **Spec requirements met** - All acceptance criteria satisfied
- [x] **Terminology standardized** - Consistent usage across all documentation
- [x] **Cross-references functional** - All links work correctly
- [x] **No breaking changes** - Workflow processes remain intact
- [x] **Validation complete** - All files reviewed for consistency

## Progress Notes
- **2025-08-21**: Spec created retroactively to document completed terminology standardization work ✅
- **2025-08-21**: All 13 documentation files updated with consistent terminology ✅
- **2025-08-21**: Cross-reference validation completed - all links functional ✅

## Implementation Notes
- Retroactive specification created to maintain compliance with spec-first development rule
- Changes improve documentation clarity without altering workflow processes
- All terminology updates preserve exact meaning while eliminating ambiguity
