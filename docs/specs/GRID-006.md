# GRID-006: Solo Development Workflow Optimization

**GitHub Issue**: #10 (public tracking)
**Spec Purpose**: Technical specification for adapting workflow to solo development reality
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-08-21

## Technical Overview
Adapt the current development workflow to accommodate solo development constraints while maintaining feature branch requirements, audit trails, and quality gates. The primary issue is that GitHub prevents self-approval of PRs, requiring workflow modification for single-developer projects while preserving all benefits when transitioning to team development.

## Implementation Requirements
- [x] Maintain mandatory feature branch creation for all workstreams
- [ ] Create solo development workflow section in process.md
- [ ] Define team development workflow section for future scaling
- [ ] Add self-merge guidelines with quality validation gates
- [ ] Update development process steps for solo context
- [ ] Preserve GitHub issue tracking and PR audit trails
- [ ] Document branch protection and repository settings
- [ ] Create quality checklist for solo development validation

## Research Notes
### Current Workflow Issues:
- **GitHub Restriction**: Cannot approve own PRs, breaking step 6-8 of current process
- **Solo Reality**: Currently only awynne develops, no external reviewer available
- **Feature Branch Requirement**: Must preserve mandatory feature branches for all work
- **Audit Trail Need**: PRs provide valuable change tracking and GitHub automation

### Workflow Requirements Analysis:
- **Spec-first development**: ✅ Keep mandatory - catches compliance issues
- **Feature branches**: ✅ Keep mandatory - prevents direct main commits
- **Issue tracking**: ✅ Keep - provides automation and public visibility
- **PR creation**: ✅ Keep - provides audit trail and GitHub automation
- **External approval**: ❌ Modify - not possible in solo development
- **Quality gates**: ✅ Enhance - add self-validation checklist

## Implementation Details

### Solo Development Workflow (Current Reality)
1. **Spec creation required** - Create spec file docs/specs/GRID-XXX.md
2. **Issue creation** - Create corresponding GitHub issue
3. **Mandatory feature branch** - Always `feature/GRID-XXX-description`
4. **Development with frequent commits** - Save progress regularly
5. **PR creation** - For audit trail and automation
6. **Self-review validation** - Use quality checklist
7. **Self-merge** - Squash merge after validation
8. **Status updates** - Update spec and status.md manually

### Team Development Workflow (Future State)
1-5. Same as solo development
6. **External review** - Architect reviews PR
7. **Feedback cycle** - Developer addresses review comments
8. **External approval and merge** - Architect merges after approval

### Quality Gates for Solo Development
Since no external reviewer, enhanced self-validation required:
- [ ] All spec requirements satisfied
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Tests pass (when applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] Cross-references and links functional
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] PR description comprehensive

## Dependencies & Integration
- Technical dependencies: None
- Repository settings: May need branch protection rule adjustments
- Cross-cutting concerns: All development workflows affected
- Integration notes: Maintains GitHub automation while enabling solo progress

## Testing Strategy
- Validation approach: Demonstrate workflow with this GRID-006 implementation
- Quality verification: Self-review checklist completion
- Process testing: Ensure feature branch → PR → merge cycle works
- Automation testing: Verify GitHub issue closure and tracking

## Definition of Done
- [x] **Spec requirements met** - All acceptance criteria satisfied
- [x] **Solo workflow documented** - Clear process for single developer
- [x] **Team workflow documented** - Future scaling path defined
- [x] **Quality gates established** - Self-validation checklist created
- [x] **Examples updated** - Workflow examples reflect solo development
- [x] **Repository guidance** - Branch protection and settings documented
- [x] **Process validated** - Successfully demonstrate new workflow

## Progress Notes
- **2025-08-21**: Spec created for solo development workflow optimization
- **2025-08-21**: Analysis completed of current workflow limitations
- **2025-08-21**: Quality gates and validation approach designed
- **2025-08-21**: Complete implementation deployed via PR #11 ✅
- **2025-08-21**: Solo development workflow validated and documented ✅

## Implementation Notes
- Maintains all workflow benefits while acknowledging GitHub's self-approval restriction
- Preserves mandatory feature branch requirement per user specification
- Establishes clear path for future team development scaling
- Enhanced quality gates compensate for lack of external review
