# Project Management Guidelines

## Spec-First Development Rule

### ‚ùó MANDATORY: No Work Without a Technical Spec
- All development must start with a documented spec in `docs/specs/GRID-XXX.md`
- Never start coding based on verbal requests or informal discussions
- Create spec file `docs/specs/GRID-XXX.md` BEFORE starting any work
- Spec must include: technical overview, implementation requirements, research notes

### Spec Creation Example
```markdown
### GRID-XXX: User Dashboard System

**GitHub Issue**: #N (public tracking)
**Spec Purpose**: Technical specification for dashboard implementation
**Status**: üìã Research  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2025-01-20  

## Technical Overview
Implement a real-time dashboard system providing project metrics and activity feeds.

#### Implementation Requirements
- [ ] Display project count widget
- [ ] Show recent activity feed (last 10 items)
- [ ] Add quick actions menu (New Project, Settings)
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- [ ] Loading states for all data

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] Component tests written
- [ ] Accessibility verified
- [ ] Works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Data loading handled gracefully
```

### What NOT to Do
```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER start work without a spec
# Manager: "Can you add a quick button to the dashboard?"
# Developer: "Sure!" *starts coding immediately*

# ‚úÖ CORRECT approach
# Manager: "Can you add a quick button to the dashboard?"
# Developer: "I'll create a spec first to document the requirements"
# *Creates spec in docs/specs/GRID-XXX.md, gets approval, then starts development*
```

### Pushing Back on Unspecified Work

When someone asks you to do work without a spec or GitHub issue, **push back confidently and politely**:

**‚úÖ Recommended Responses:**
- *"I'd be happy to help with that. Let me create a GRID spec first to document the requirements and approach."*
- *"This sounds important. Can we create a GitHub issue and spec so we can track it properly and ensure we build the right thing?"*
- *"Before I start, I need to create a spec to clarify the requirements. This will help us avoid scope creep and ensure quality."*
- *"Our process requires a spec for all development work. I can create GRID-XXX for this - it'll take 10 minutes and save us hours later."*

**Why This Matters:**
- **Prevents scope creep** - Clear requirements upfront
- **Ensures quality** - Proper planning and acceptance criteria
- **Maintains consistency** - All work follows same documentation standards
- **Enables tracking** - Progress visibility and audit trail
- **Reduces rework** - Requirements clarified before implementation

**Even for "Quick" Tasks:**
- 5-minute tasks often become 2-hour tasks without proper specification
- "Simple" requests frequently have hidden complexity
- Quick specs (even 1-2 paragraphs) prevent misunderstandings
- Documentation time investment pays dividends in implementation speed

### Spec-Driven Development Benefits
- Clear requirements prevent scope creep
- Documented decisions in docs/specs/ directory
- Proper estimation and planning
- Accountability and progress tracking
- Single source of truth in repository

## Development Process Integration

### Solo Development Process (Current Reality)
**Context**: Single developer (awynne) with GitHub self-approval restriction

1. **Spec creation required** - Create spec file docs/specs/GRID-XXX.md with clear requirements
2. **Issue creation** - Create corresponding GitHub issue for public tracking and automation
3. **Mandatory feature branch** - Always create `feature/GRID-XXX-description` (NEVER commit directly to main)
4. **Development with frequent commits** - Save progress regularly to feature branch (status: üîÑ In Progress)
5. **PR creation** - Create PR for audit trail and GitHub automation (status: üëÄ Review)
6. **Self-review validation** - Use quality checklist to validate work meets standards
7. **Self-merge** - Squash merge after validation (GitHub prevents self-approval)
8. **Status updates** - Issue auto-closes; manually update GRID-XXX.md status and docs/specs/status.md with completion date

### Team Development Process (Future State)
**Context**: Multiple developers with external review capability

1. **Spec creation required** - Create spec file docs/specs/GRID-XXX.md with clear requirements
2. **Issue creation** - Create corresponding GitHub issue for public tracking and automation
3. **Mandatory feature branch** - Always create `feature/GRID-XXX-description` (NEVER commit directly to main)
4. **Development with frequent commits** - Save progress regularly to feature branch (status: üîÑ In Progress)
5. **PR creation** - Create PR when definition of done achieved (status: üëÄ Review)
6. **External review** - Architect/senior developer reviews PR for technical quality and requirements
7. **Feedback cycle** - Developer addresses review comments with additional commits
8. **External approval and merge** - Reviewer approves and merges PR with squash merge
9. **Status updates** - Issue auto-closes; manually update GRID-XXX.md status and docs/specs/status.md with completion date

### Integration with Git Workflow & GitHub Issues
- **Branch naming**: Use task ID in branch name (`feature/GRID-XXX-description`)
- **Commit messages**: Include both IDs (`feat(auth): add OAuth (GRID-XXX, #45)`)
- **PR linking**: Reference both systems (`Closes GRID-XXX` and `Closes #45`)
- **Dual tracking**: GRID-XXX.md files for detailed specs, GitHub issues for public tracking
- **Spec status updates**: 
  - üîÑ In Progress: During development (update both systems)
  - üëÄ Review: When PR created and ready for architect review
  - ‚úÖ Completed: GitHub issue auto-closes, manually update GRID-XXX.md status
- **Spec closure**: Issues close automatically; update GRID-XXX.md status and docs/specs/status.md with completion date manually

## GitHub Issues Integration

### Triple-Track System
The project uses a **triple-track system** combining product features, technical specifications, and GitHub automation:

1. **Product Features** - Strategic feature definitions in `docs/product/features.md` (F0-F4)
2. **GRID-XXX.md files** - Detailed technical specifications, acceptance criteria, and progress notes
3. **GitHub Issues** - Implementation tracking, automation, and workflow integration

### Feature-to-Issue Workflow
Features (F0-F4) from product documentation map directly to implementation issues without intermediate story layers:

- **Features** define user value and strategic direction
- **Issues** track specific implementation tasks
- **Specs** provide technical implementation details

**Example Flow:**
- F1: Daily Pulse (strategic feature) ‚Üí Multiple GitHub issues for implementation ‚Üí GRID specs for technical details

### Creating Issues from Features

Use the GitHub issue templates to create issues that link back to product features:

```bash
# For feature implementation
gh issue create --template feature.yml --title "[Feature] Daily pulse data display" \
  --label "epic:f1-daily-pulse,type:feature"

# For technical debt  
gh issue create --template tech-debt.yml --title "[Tech] Database partitioning for time-series data" \
  --label "type:tech-debt,priority:high"

# For bugs
gh issue create --template bug.yml --title "[Bug] Chart rendering fails on mobile" \
  --label "type:bug,severity:medium"
```

### Issue Template Integration
The project includes three GitHub issue templates:

- **feature.yml** - Links to product epics (F0-F4) with structured fields
- **tech-debt.yml** - Categorizes technical work (infrastructure, performance, etc.)
- **bug.yml** - Captures bug reports with severity levels

### Creating Issues from Specs
```bash
# After creating GRID-XXX.md file, create corresponding issue
gh issue create --title "GRID-123: Add user authentication system" \
  --body "Detailed specifications: [GRID-123](docs/specs/GRID-123.md)

Summary of key requirements:
- OAuth integration with Google/Microsoft
- Session management with sliding expiration  
- User profile creation and management

See full acceptance criteria in the spec file."

# Issue gets assigned #45, now reference both: GRID-123 and #45
```

### Linking to Specs in Issues
To ensure that links to specs within GitHub Issues are permanent and not subject to future changes, always use absolute URLs that point to the specific commit hash of the pull request that closed the issue.

**Why is this important?**
Relative links like `[GRID-123](docs/specs/GRID-123.md)` will always point to the latest version of the spec in the `main` branch. This can cause confusion when reviewing closed issues, as the spec may have been updated since the issue was resolved. Using a permanent link to a specific commit hash ensures that the link always shows the spec as it was when the issue was closed.

**How to get the permanent link:**
1. Find the pull request that closed the issue.
2. Get the merge commit hash of that pull request.
3. Construct the URL with the following format: `https://github.com/awynne/grid/blob/COMMIT_HASH/docs/specs/GRID-XXX.md`

**Example:**
`[GRID-005](https://github.com/awynne/grid/blob/ceaaf4a342687437b211433bac0babf67cf1e851/docs/specs/GRID-005.md)`


### Enhanced Commit Messages
```bash
# ‚úÖ Include GRID-XXX, GitHub issue number, and epic context when applicable
git commit -m "feat(daily-pulse): add real-time data display (GRID-123, #45)"
git commit -m "fix(dashboard): resolve loading race condition (GRID-456, #78)"
git commit -m "docs(api): update integration guide (GRID-202, #91)"

# For epic-related work, include epic reference
git commit -m "feat(f1-daily-pulse): implement chart components (GRID-124, #46)"
```

### Enhanced PR Creation
```bash
# ‚úÖ Reference both systems for automatic linking
gh pr create --title "feat(auth): Add OAuth authentication system" \
  --body "Implements GRID-123: User authentication system

## Summary
- Add Google and Microsoft OAuth providers
- Implement session management with sliding expiration
- Create user profile management workflow

## Testing
- [x] OAuth flow tested with both providers
- [x] Session management verified
- [x] User profile creation works
- [x] Error handling for failed OAuth

Closes GRID-123
Closes #45"
```

### GitHub Labels and Milestones

The project uses structured labels for organization and filtering:

**Epic Labels** (link to product features):
