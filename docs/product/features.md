## Feature Specifications

### F0: Shared Shell & Freshness

**User Story:** As any user, I want consistent BA/date controls, deep links, and clear data freshness so I trust what I'm seeing and can share exact views.

**Problem:** Users can't tell what's fresh, and shared URLs don't reliably reproduce the same view.

**Outcome:** Trust and shareability via consistent BA/date controls, deep links, and visible freshness.

**Success Metrics:**
- â‰¥20% of sessions copy or share a deep link
- <10% of sessions encounter a stale-data warning (and tooltip explains cause)
- â‰¥95% of deep-link loads reproduce identical state (BA/date/visible series)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- BA selector with typeahead search and geo-location defaults
- Date controls with presets (Today/Yesterday/Last 7d) and custom picker
- URL parameters reflect all selections for deep linking
- Per-series freshness badges with last-updated timestamps
- Graceful error states with informative messages
- Keyboard accessible navigation and controls

**Implementation Status**: [Track on GitHub](https://github.com/awynne/grid/issues?q=label%3Aepic%3Af0-shared-shell)

### F1: Daily Pulse

**User Story:** As a reporter or energy blogger, I want a concise daily brief with an annotated chart for my BA so I can publish or embed a trustworthy update quickly.

**Problem:** Reporters need a fast, accurate daily update they can reuse without hand-curating charts.

**Outcome:** One-click brief with headline, bullets, and annotated chart; embeddable and shareable.

**Success Metrics:**
- â‰¥10% of sessions use "Copy link/Embed"
- 100% headline/annotation accuracy vs computed series in QA
- Median time-to-first-embed â‰¤60s for first-time visitors

**Functional Requirements:**

**Inputs:** Hourly demand, generation by fuel, day-ahead forecast, interchange (optional), COâ‚‚ (optional).

**Computation:**
- Identify **peak hour** & **trough**
- Compute **largest deviation vs day-ahead forecast** (if forecast available)
- Detect **notable ramp** (max Î” over 1h within 15:00â€“21:00)
- Generate copy via templates with thresholds (e.g., "X% above typical", "cleanest hour at HH:00")

**Outputs:** Headline, 3â€“5 bullets, annotated chart, shareable permalink, embed snippet.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Headlines avoid jargon, fit â‰¤120 chars, and never contradict chart values
- Annotated fuel-mix + demand chart with peak/trough/ramp markers
- Hover tooltips show exact values, legend toggles visibility
- Copy permalink and embed snippet (oEmbed/iFrame support)
- PNG download capability
- Renders identically when embedded

### F2: What's Powering Me

**User Story:** As a consumer/prosumer or facilities operator, I want to see current COâ‚‚ intensity and the next clean window for my BA so I can time flexible loads and lower emissions without effort.

**Problem:** People don't know when electricity is cleanest to shift flexible loads.

**Outcome:** Clear COâ‚‚ status and the next clean window with simple guidance.

**Success Metrics:**
- â‰¥30% open the clean-window tooltip or band details
- â‰¥60% of eligible sessions display a clean window within the next 24h
- COâ‚‚ fallback estimation error <2% vs native COâ‚‚ where available

**Functional Requirements:**

**Inputs:** Hourly fuel mix &/or COâ‚‚ estimate for selected BA; next 24â€“48h horizon.

**Computation:**
- If COâ‚‚ available, use it; else estimate from fuel mix via fixed intensity factors
- Compute **"clean windows"**: contiguous blocks where intensity is in the top (cleanest) quartile for the next 24h
- Output next window bounds & a compact hour-band visualization

**Outputs:** Current intensity status; next clean window; micro-copy suggestions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Current COâ‚‚ intensity pill with timestamped freshness badge
- Next clean window computation with startâ€“end times
- 24-hour band visualization colored by COâ‚‚ quartiles
- Fuel-mix fallback with disclaimer tooltip when COâ‚‚ data unavailable
- Window aligns with underlying series within one refresh cycle
- Simple guidance text for load shifting

### F3: Duck Days

**User Story:** As an analyst or educator, I want to surface the "duckiest" days and explain net-load dynamics so I can teach and communicate grid flexibility needs.

**Problem:** It's hard to find and explain "duck curve" days quickly.

**Outcome:** Ranked gallery and annotated detail that make the dynamics obvious.

**Success Metrics:**
- â‰¥40% of gallery viewers click a day detail
- Median time on a detail â‰¥20s
- Score reproducibility: 100% stability on re-run with unchanged data

**Functional Requirements:**

**Inputs:** Hourly demand & solar generation (or proxy from fuel mix).

**Computation:**
- **Net load** = demand âˆ’ solar
- **Duckiness score (0â€“100):** 50% evening ramp rate (3â€“9pm), 35% valley depth (maxâˆ’midday min), 15% trough time (earlier = higher)
- Rank last 60 days; store top N

**Outputs:** Gallery cards; detail chart with annotations; compare vs typical weekday curve.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Score = 0â€“100 using ramp/valley/trough formula; reproducible and stored daily
- Gallery shows 8 cards with date+score+sparkline; stable ranking unless new data
- Day detail with net-load line + fuel-mix area chart
- Annotations for trough time, evening ramp rate
- Overlay comparison with typical weekday curve
- Score explanation tooltip ("why this score?")

**Implementation Status**: [Track on GitHub](https://github.com/awynne/grid/issues?q=label%3Aepic%3Af3-duck-days)

### F4: What Changed

**User Story:** As an executive, PM, or analyst, I want a one-glance summary of yesterday vs baseline so I can spot material changes and drill into the relevant hour.

**Problem:** Busy stakeholders lack a quick sense of what materially changed yesterday.

**Outcome:** Delta cards that spotlight peaks, cleanest hour, ramps, and interchange.

**Success Metrics:**
- â‰¥35% of users click at least one KPI card
- Tooltip open rate â‰¥25%
- Baseline calculation job success rate â‰¥99%

**Functional Requirements:**

**Inputs:** Yesterday's hourly series; 30-day same-weekday baseline.

**Computation:** KPIs: max demand; cleanest hour (min COâ‚‚); largest ramp (max 1h Î”); biggest interchange swing (max |Î”| across ties).

**Outputs:** KPI cards with Î” vs baseline; tooltips show absolute & % change.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Four KPI cards: max demand, cleanest hour, largest ramp, interchange swing
- Absolute + percentage deltas vs baseline clearly displayed
- Baseline window documented in tooltip (30-day same-weekday median)
- Clicking KPI deep-links to selected day with annotations
- Baseline calculation job runs reliably with â‰¥99% success rate
- KPI values match source series exactly

**Implementation Status**: [Track on GitHub](https://github.com/awynne/grid/issues?q=label%3Aepic%3Af4-what-changed)

## Formulas Reference

### Net Load & Duckiness Calculations
- **Net Load** = `demand âˆ’ solar_generation` (proxy from fuel mix where needed)
- **Evening Ramp (MW/h)** = `max( net(t+1) âˆ’ net(t) )` over 15:00â€“21:00
- **Valley Depth (MW)** = `max_day(net) âˆ’ min_midday(net; 10:00â€“15:00)`
- **Duckiness (0â€“100)** = `w1*z(ramp) + w2*z(valley) + w3*z(-trough_time)` with `w1=0.5, w2=0.35, w3=0.15`

### Clean Windows
- **Clean Windows:** contiguous hours where `COâ‚‚_intensity â‰¤ Q1` (cleanest quartile) in next 24h

### Mapping Guidelines

**1:Many Relationship**: Most features require multiple specs for complete implementation
- Features define user value and acceptance criteria
- Specs define technical implementation details and architecture

**Shared Infrastructure**: Some specs support multiple features
- GRID-007, GRID-008: Foundation for all features
- GRID-009, GRID-010: Common components used across features

**Implementation Order**: Infrastructure specs enable feature specs
1. **Phase 1**: GRID-007, GRID-008 (data and architecture foundation)
2. **Phase 2**: GRID-009, GRID-010 (common components)  
3. **Phase 3**: Feature-specific specs (GRID-011+)

**Status Legend**: 
- âœ… **Created** - Spec file exists with technical details
- ðŸ”„ **Planning** - Feature requirements defined, spec creation needed
- ðŸ†• **New** - Spec created but implementation not started
