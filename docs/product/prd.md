## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
A lightweight, near-real-time web app that turns hourly grid data into: a daily story, personal "what to do now/next," an exploration of duck-curve dynamics, and a one-glance change summary.

### Product Mission
Transform scattered grid charts into actionable insights for reporters, consumers, analysts, and executives using EIA-930 data.

### Value Proposition
**Problem:** People see scattered grid charts but don't get quick, actionable or narrative insights.
**Solution:** GridPulse provides four focused experiences that turn raw EIA-930 data into immediately useful information.

### Problem Statement
Electric grid data is published hourly by EIA-930 but remains fragmented across different charts and dashboards. Users struggle to:
- Extract narrative insights for reporting
- Know when electricity is cleanest for load shifting
- Understand duck curve patterns and grid dynamics
- Quickly identify material changes from baseline

### Solution Overview
GridPulse delivers four core experiences:
1. **Daily Pulse** - Auto-generated daily narrative + annotated chart
2. **What's Powering Me** - Current COâ‚‚ intensity + next clean window
3. **Duck Days** - Discoverable gallery of duck curve patterns
4. **What Changed** - Daily diff cards vs baseline metrics

## Target Audience

- **Advanced Alerts**: Email/SMS notifications for grid events
- **Regional Analysis**: Multi-BA comparisons and regional insights
- **Educational Content**: Guided tutorials and explanations

### Long-term Vision (1+ years)
- **Global Expansion**: International grid data sources beyond US
- **Real-time Features**: Sub-hourly data where available
- **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning for demand and generation forecasting
- **Policy Tools**: Regulatory analysis and scenario modeling

### Potential Integrations
- **Weather APIs**: Correlation with weather patterns
- **Carbon Tracking**: Integration with corporate sustainability platforms
- **Educational LMS**: Content for energy courses and training
- **Utility APIs**: Direct data feeds from progressive utilities

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Data Dependency**: Limited to EIA-930 availability and accuracy
- **API Rate Limits**: EIA v2 API throttling affects ingestion frequency
- **Time Zone Complexity**: Balancing authority boundaries vs time zones
- **Behind-the-Meter Solar**: Net-load calculations are approximations

### Business Constraints
- **Public Data Only**: Cannot access proprietary utility data
- **No Revenue Model**: Free public service limits monetization options
- **Regulatory Sensitivity**: Energy data requires careful interpretation
- **Attribution Requirements**: Must credit EIA as data source

### Resource Constraints
- **Solo Development**: Limited by single developer bandwidth
- **Infrastructure Budget**: Target <$50/month for MVP scale
- **Data Storage**: Costs scale with retention period and BA coverage
- **API Costs**: Potential future charges for high-volume EIA access

### Assumptions
- **EIA Stability**: API structure and data quality remain consistent
- **User Interest**: Demand exists for accessible grid data insights
- **Technical Stack**: Remix/Railway ecosystem meets scaling needs
- **Data Freshness**: Users accept 1-2 hour lag for non-demand data

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Data lag creates confusion**: Users expect real-time but get 1-2 hour delays
- **Coverage gaps across BAs**: Not all regions report all data series
- **EIA API changes**: Endpoint modifications could break ingestion
- **Query performance degradation**: Time-series data growth impacts response times

### Business Risks
- **Low user adoption**: Market may be smaller than anticipated
- **Misinterpretation of data**: Users draw incorrect conclusions from visualizations
- **Competition from utilities**: Utilities may create superior internal tools
- **Regulatory sensitivity**: Incorrect analysis could influence policy decisions

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Freshness transparency**: Per-series badges, tooltips explain lags, avoid "real-time" claims
- **Graceful degradation**: Default to well-covered BAs, show skeletons for missing data
- **API monitoring**: Smoke tests, versioning, fallback to cached data
- **Performance planning**: GRID-007 data volume analysis, TimescaleDB migration path
- **User education**: Clear disclaimers, formula explanations, methodology transparency
- **Quality assurance**: 100% accuracy requirement, automated validation checks
