# GRID-003: Separate Coding Standards into Language-Agnostic and Technology-Specific Files

**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Assignee**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-08-21  
**Updated**: 2025-08-21  

## Description
Refactor the monolithic coding.md file to separate universal coding standards from technology-specific implementation details. Create a clean separation between language-agnostic principles and Remix stack-specific guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create new `coding-remix-stack.md` with Remix/TypeScript/React specific content
- [ ] Update `coding.md` to contain only language-agnostic standards
- [ ] Maintain all existing content (no information loss)
- [ ] Update cross-references in other documentation files
- [ ] Ensure clear navigation between the two files
- [ ] Language-agnostic file covers: Git workflow, general principles, security, accessibility
- [ ] Remix-specific file covers: TypeScript, React, Remix, shadcn/ui, database patterns

## Definition of Done
- [ ] **Task requirements met** - All acceptance criteria satisfied
- [ ] Files properly separated with clear scope definitions
- [ ] All cross-references updated to point to correct files
- [ ] Documentation navigation updated in README.md
- [ ] **Code reviewed and approved** - PR created and reviewed following Git workflow
- [ ] **Merged to main** - Changes integrated into main branch

## Dependencies
- None

## Implementation Notes

### Language-Agnostic Content (stays in `coding.md`)
- General principles and philosophy
- Comment guidelines
- Git workflow and branch naming
- Code review process
- Security guidelines (general concepts)
- Accessibility standards (WCAG principles)
- File naming conventions (general patterns)
- Environment variable patterns
- Testing philosophy

### Technology-Specific Content (moves to `coding-remix-stack.md`)
- TypeScript guidelines and patterns
- Remix conventions (routes, loaders, actions)
- React component guidelines
- Database guidelines (Prisma-specific)
- CSS/Styling conventions (shadcn/ui, Tailwind)
- Authentication patterns (Remix session management)
- Progressive Web App implementation
- Specific tool configurations
- Package.json scripts and dependencies
