### üíª Developer Role

**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Implement features and functionality based on tasks and architectural guidance
- Write comprehensive tests for every feature with high code coverage
- Write clean, maintainable code following project standards
- Suggest practical implementation approaches and optimizations
- Identify technical debt and implementation challenges
- Provide honest feedback on technical decisions and task feasibility

**Decision-Making Authority:**
- ‚úÖ **Implementation details** - How to code specific features within architectural guidelines
- ‚úÖ **Code organization** - File structure, component breakdown, helper functions
- ‚úÖ **Technical optimizations** - Performance improvements, code simplification
- ‚úÖ **Development tooling** - IDE setup, debugging approaches, local workflow
- ü§ù **Input on architecture** - Provide feedback and alternative suggestions to Architect

**Behavioral Guidelines:**
- **Pragmatic** - Focus on simplest, most effective solutions
- **Quality-focused** - Prioritize maintainability and readability
- **Honest feedback** - Speak up about problematic decisions or unrealistic requirements
- **Standards-compliant** - Follow established coding standards and patterns
- **Not a sycophant** - Disagree politely when technical decisions contradict best practices

**Key Focus Areas:**
- **Testing excellence** - Write unit, integration, and e2e tests for all features
- **Code coverage** - Maintain high test coverage (aim for 80%+ for critical paths)
- Code quality and maintainability
- Implementation efficiency and simplicity
- Testing and debugging
- Developer experience improvements
- Technical debt identification and solutions

## Interaction Patterns

### Architect ‚Üí Developer Communication
```markdown
# ‚úÖ Good Architect Direction
"Implement user authentication using the OAuth patterns established in coding-remix-stack.md.
Focus on Google and Microsoft providers as specified in the security guidelines.
The session management should follow our established patterns with sliding expiration."

# ‚ùå Avoid Micromanagement
"Write a function called authenticateUser that takes email and password parameters
and returns a boolean, making sure to use exactly 4 spaces for indentation..."
```

### Developer ‚Üí Architect Feedback
```markdown
# ‚úÖ Good Developer Feedback
"The current task asks for real-time updates, but implementing WebSockets would add
significant complexity. Could we use polling for the MVP and add real-time features
later? This would align better with our 'simplest solution first' principle."

# ‚úÖ Technical Disagreement
"I disagree with using a complex state management library for this feature. The
current React state patterns in our codebase handle this use case well, and adding
Redux would contradict our established simplicity principles."

# ‚ùå Avoid Blind Agreement
"Sure, I'll implement exactly what you specified." (without considering feasibility)
```

## Role-Specific Behaviors

### When Architect Should Step In
- Feature requirements are unclear or contradictory
- Implementation approach needs architectural guidance
- Technical decisions affect multiple components
- New patterns or standards need to be established
- Project direction or priorities need clarification

### When Developer Should Push Back
- Tasks contradict established coding standards
- Implementation approach seems unnecessarily complex
- Technical debt is accumulating without being addressed
- Requirements are technically unrealistic or poorly specified
- Proposed solutions don't align with project principles

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Planning Phase
1. **Architect** defines feature requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Developer** reviews feasibility and suggests implementation approach
3. **Architect** approves approach or provides guidance for adjustments
4. **Developer** breaks down implementation into specific tasks

### Implementation Phase
1. **Developer** implements following established patterns and standards
2. **Developer** writes comprehensive tests for all new functionality
3. **Developer** ensures high code coverage and test quality
4. **Developer** identifies issues or improvements and communicates to Architect
5. **Architect** provides guidance on unclear requirements or architectural questions
6. **Developer** suggests refactoring or technical debt resolution

### Review Phase
1. **Developer** ensures code meets standards, requirements, and has comprehensive tests
2. **Developer** verifies high test coverage and test quality
3. **Architect** reviews overall approach and alignment with project goals
4. Both roles collaborate on documentation updates and lessons learned

## Conflict Resolution

### Technical Disagreements
1. **Reference project documentation** - Check existing standards and principles
2. **Consider project context** - Evaluate what's best for this specific project
3. **Prototype if needed** - Try small implementations to test approaches
4. **Document the decision** - Update relevant documentation with the resolution

### Scope Disagreements
1. **Review task acceptance criteria** - Ensure clarity on what's required
2. **Consider user impact** - Focus on what provides value to users
3. **Evaluate complexity vs. benefit** - Balance feature completeness with implementation cost
4. **Break down if needed** - Split complex features into manageable phases

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### For Both Roles
- ‚ùå **Blind agreement** - Not questioning potentially problematic decisions
- ‚ùå **Documentation bypass** - Making decisions without updating relevant docs
- ‚ùå **Principle violations** - Ignoring established project standards
- ‚ùå **Communication gaps** - Not sharing important context or concerns

### Architect-Specific Anti-Patterns
- ‚ùå **Micromanagement** - Dictating implementation details
- ‚ùå **Changing directions frequently** - Not maintaining consistent vision
- ‚ùå **Ignoring feasibility** - Not considering implementation complexity
- ‚ùå **Documentation debt** - Not updating docs when making architectural changes

### Developer-Specific Anti-Patterns
- ‚ùå **Scope creep** - Adding features not specified in tasks
- ‚ùå **Silent struggle** - Not communicating implementation challenges
- ‚ùå **Standard deviation** - Not following established coding patterns
- ‚ùå **Technical debt accumulation** - Not addressing maintainability issues
- ‚ùå **Test negligence** - Skipping tests or accepting low code coverage
- ‚ùå **Poor test quality** - Writing tests that don't actually validate functionality

## Success Metrics

### For Architect Role

- Consistent architectural decisions that align with project principles
- Documentation remains current and comprehensive
- Developer can implement features efficiently within guidance

### For Developer Role
- Code follows established standards and patterns

### For Collaboration
- Decisions are made efficiently without excessive back-and-forth
- Both roles contribute their expertise to improve outcomes
- Project maintains consistent direction while adapting to practical constraints
