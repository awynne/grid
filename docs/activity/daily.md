**GitHub Issues Completed**: [GRID-007 #13](https://github.com/awynne/grid/issues/13)

- 🔄 **GRID-007**: Comprehensive EIA-930 data volume analysis completed with definitive database architecture recommendations
- 📚 **Data Analysis**: Downloaded and analyzed 563MB EIA bulk data (3.7GB uncompressed) containing 132M+ records across 3,010 time series
- 📚 **Performance Testing**: Built test database with 7,850 records, benchmarked query performance, validated scaling projections
- 📚 **Architecture Decision**: Updated recommendation from "PostgreSQL first, migrate later" to "TimescaleDB from Small Scale onward" based on minimal implementation effort analysis (+0.5 hours)
- 📚 **Validation**: Rigorous accuracy validation including cross-reference with actual EIA data, multiple BA complexity scenarios, and edge case testing
- 🚀 **Documentation**: Created 50+ page comprehensive report with implementation-ready SQL examples and precise storage/cost projections

### [Date]

**GitHub Issues Completed**: [GRID-XXX #N](https://github.com/awynne/grid/issues/N), [GRID-YYY #M](https://github.com/awynne/grid/issues/M)

- 🔄 **GRID-XXX**: [Brief development context or progress notes]
- 📚 **Research**: [Investigation findings, decisions made, alternatives considered]
- 📚 **Documentation**: [Documentation updates, process improvements]
- 🚀 **Infrastructure**: [Setup, tooling, environment changes]
- 🐛 **Debug**: [Bug investigation, troubleshooting context]
```

**Focus**: Context and decisions that GitHub Issues don't capture - research findings, architecture decisions, debugging insights, and non-issue development activities.

## Activity Categories
- **🔄 Development** - Implementation progress, technical decisions, code insights
- **📚 Research** - Investigation findings, architecture decisions, alternative analysis
- **📚 Documentation** - Process improvements, template updates, guideline changes  
- **🚀 Infrastructure** - Environment setup, tooling, CI/CD, deployment
- **🐛 Debug** - Bug investigation context, troubleshooting insights
- **🎨 Design** - UI/UX decisions, design system evolution

## Activity Guidelines
- **GitHub Issues Summary**: List completed issues daily with direct links
- **Focus on Context**: Capture WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was done
- **Research Notes**: Document investigation findings and alternatives considered
- **Technical Decisions**: Record architecture choices and rationale
- **Avoid Duplication**: Don't repeat information already in GitHub Issues/PRs

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Daily Updates
