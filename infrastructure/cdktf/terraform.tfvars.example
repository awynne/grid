# GridPulse Infrastructure Variables
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your values

# Railway Configuration
railway_token = "your-railway-api-token-here"
project_id = "10593acb-4a7a-4331-a993-52d24860d1fa"

# Database Configuration

# Application Configuration

# ==============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================

# Docker Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
# Use Docker images for fast, reliable, consistent deployments
docker_image = "ghcr.io/awynne/grid:latest"        # Docker image with tag
docker_username = "your-github-username"           # GitHub username  
docker_password = "your-github-token"              # GitHub personal access token

# Git Deployment (FALLBACK/DEVELOPMENT)
# Use Git source for development or when Docker images aren't available
source_repo = "awynne/grid"                        # Git repository
source_repo_branch = "main"                        # Git branch

# ==============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT METHOD SELECTION
# ==============================================================================
# 
# If docker_image is provided, Docker deployment will be used (recommended)
# If docker_image is empty, Git deployment will be used as fallback
#
# PRODUCTION: Always use Docker deployment with specific tags (not :latest)
# DEVELOPMENT: Can use either method, Git is acceptable for rapid iteration
# 
# Benefits of Docker deployment:
# - Faster deployments (no build time on Railway)
# - Consistent environments (same image across test/prod) 
# - Easy rollbacks (pin to specific image tags)
# - Better reliability (pre-tested images)
